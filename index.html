				<a href="files/ideas_poster.pdf"><img src="images/ideas_poster.png"></a>
				<p>This is a diagram grouping 20 possible solutions to the problem into 5 clusters. 
				   The clusters are social media, clubs/organizations, community outreach, businesses, 
				   education reform. There are many possible solutions and they all have upsides and downsides.  
				   I wanted to focus on educating the general public regardless of their social status.</p>
